You know that feeling when you finally reach the top of a mountain after what feels like forever, legs burning, breath heavy, but then you look around, and suddenly, it’s all worth it? 

That’s the kind of moment that sticks with you—the kind that makes you forget how tired you were just a second ago. I live for that feeling, for the places that make you pause and just take it all in, whether it’s:
- Standing in front of a centuries-old building, running my hands over stone walls that have seen more history than I ever will.
- Watching life unfold in a small mountain town where time seems to move a little slower.

I felt that slowness in the best way possible when I stayed in **Khairagali** for a week, away from the rush of everyday life, surrounded by nothing but nature and the sound of my own thoughts. There was something about:
- Waking up to mist rolling over the hills.
- Drinking chai without worrying about what’s next.
- Just existing in a space where life felt beautifully simple.

Maybe that’s why I’ve always been drawn to places with history, like the **UK**, where old buildings hold stories in their walls, and time feels like it stretches a little further back. 

Give me a group of good people, a solid food tour, and some forgotten streets to wander, and I’m set. Because at the end of the day, **travel isn’t just about seeing new places—it’s about feeling them, carrying a piece of them with you, and maybe, just maybe, finding a little more of yourself along the way.**
